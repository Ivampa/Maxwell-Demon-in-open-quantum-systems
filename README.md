# Maxwell-Demon-in-open-quantum-systems
In this project I´ll explore a quantum implementation of a Maxwell’s demon using coupled quantum dots and open quantum system dynamics by means of density matrix and Lindblad formalisms. QuTiP-based simulations and codes, will be added in future iterations. As for now, I´m only uploading the thesis itself. Also, other demons will be studied as well
